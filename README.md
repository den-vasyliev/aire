## About

AIRE is an open-source framework that applies Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles and practices to AI systems. It provides a comprehensive toolkit and methodology for AI/ML practitioners, Data Engineers, DevOps, and SRE teams to develop, deliver, and operate reliable AI products.

As AI becomes critical for business competitiveness, organizations face unique challenges in integrating these systems reliably and securely. AIRE bridges this gap by combining CNCF ecosystem tools with established SRE practices to enhance AI system reliability, security, and business alignment.

## Why AIRE?

AI systems present unique operational challenges that traditional SRE practices don't fully address:

### Key Challenges
- **Limited Visibility**: Lack of control over AI lifecycle including data collection, model deployment, and monitoring
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring model robustness against prompt attacks, data drift, and performance degradation
- **Complexity Management**: Handling intricate dependencies, configurations, and resources across environments
- **Security Concerns**: Protecting against data leakage, bias, and malicious attacks
- **Operational Integration**: Incorporating AI systems into existing DevOps workflows

AIRE addresses these challenges by providing:
- A structured approach to AI system reliability
- Tools and practices for managing AI-specific risks
- Methods for defining and measuring AI system reliability
- Integration patterns for existing MLOps and DevOps workflows
- Standardized processes for AI operations

## Features

### LLM Delivery and Deployment with Kubernetes Controllers
Based on the Flux OCI architecture, AIRE provides a streamlined approach for deploying LLMs to Kubernetes:
- **GitOps-driven Deployment**: Utilize custom controllers to manage LLM deployments through Git workflows
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define LLM configurations, resource requirements, and scaling policies declaratively
- **Automated Rollouts**: Support for canary deployments and automated rollbacks
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligent scheduling and resource management for GPU/CPU workloads
- **Model Versioning**: Integrated version control and model artifact management
- **Standardized OCI Image Format**: Ensure consistency by unifying LLM deployments around the OCI image format

### Observability with OpenInference
Leveraging OpenInference for comprehensive LLM observability:
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end visibility into LLM request flows and chain-of-thought processes
- **Performance Metrics**: Track latency, throughput, and resource utilization
- **Semantic Logging**: Structured logging for prompt engineering and response analysis
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track token usage and associated costs
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor hallucination rates, response quality, and model drift

### Reliability with AI Gateway
Following industry best practices for AI gateway implementation:
- **Traffic Management**: Rate limiting, load balancing, and request routing
- **Security Controls**: Authentication, authorization, and prompt validation
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart caching and request batching
- **Model Governance**: Version control, A/B testing, and shadow deployment
- **API Standardization**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers

## Key Benefits

### For Organizations
